# Fuzzy Sleep Quality Recommendation

## Overview

This project is a fuzzy logic-based system that recommends personalized advice to improve sleep quality.  
It takes into account:

- Sleep Duration
- Screen Time Before Bed
- Stress Level
- Room Environment

It uses **Flask** (for the web app), **scikit-fuzzy** (for fuzzy logic), and **Matplotlib** (for visualizations).

---

## Features

- Input your current sleep-related habits.
- Get an estimated sleep quality (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent).
- Receive actionable recommendations tailored to your situation.
- Visualize fuzzy membership functions for all input and output variables.
- Clean and user-friendly interface with a responsive design.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuzzy-sleep-quality.git
   cd fuzzy-sleep-quality
   ```

2. **(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
